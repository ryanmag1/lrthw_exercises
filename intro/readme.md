#### Please explain these three skills in your own words.

###### Reading and Writing

The author is literally referring developing the skill to read the code samples and type them out.  Do not take 
shortcuts, do not cut and paste.  Read the excersises, type them into your ruby files.

###### Attention to detail

Attention to detail is as important to coding as it is to mathmatics.  Being 90% right results in an incorrect answer.

###### Spotting differences

Author is referring to developing the skill to compare two lines of code and having the ability to spot the differences.
That sounds obvious and... it is, but I understand the importance. A good coder needs to be able to 'read' code
and spot the errors just as a foriegn language teacher would spot grammatical errors in a student's work.

#### Why do you need to not copy and paste?

For the same reason you have to speak a language you are learning.  In the case of a spoken language, you need train your tongue and brain to work together.  In the case of coding languages, it's your fingers and brain.

#### Why is Practice and Persistence important?

Because it's easy to give up.  Easy to make excuses why you coudln't learn something. No one has ever acheived greatness without being persistant.
